FROGGER GAME

Completed this project as part of Udacity's Object oriented Javascript Course.

Implemented a basic frogger game, where the user uses the 4 arrow keys to move around and reach the water to win. Hitting a bug kills the user's character. Further plan on implementing scores in the future.
